Here I feel the touch brought by the real number solution (Mmm)
Ripples of two souls now have reach our double slits

Casting stripes of light and dark
In the world as days and nights
You set me free under the sun
I fly your cradle dreams to the moon and back

A worm will turn into a butterfly
Before one can answer, "Who am I?"
After the ice turns into water
The sea I hang upside down will be your sky
